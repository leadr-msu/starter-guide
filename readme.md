##General Tips and Tricks
###Shortcuts
There are a few keyboard shortcuts in particular that can save lots of time or headaches. Here are just a few that may be useful on a daily basis:

- Copy - Ctrl+c/Cmd+c
- Paste - Ctrl+v/Cmd+v
- Paste without formatting
	- Sometimes you'll copy text that includes formatting (bullets, italics, colors, etc.) and you just want to paste the plain text. This works in most applications (some may also have a Paste Special option in the toolbar).
- Undo - Ctrl+v/Cmd+v
	- Redo is Ctrl+y/Cmd+y
- Select all - Ctrl+a/Cmd+a
	- Selects all of the text in a window or the selected field in most any program
- Find - Ctrl+f/Cmd+f
	-Opens a text search feature that will locate and highlight the text you're looking for in most any program
- Save - Ctrl+s/Cmd+s
	-Saves the current file for most applications.

###Managing Multiple Google Accounts
Do you have more than one Gmail or Google Apps account and find yourself constantly signing out and signing back in again? Do you share a computer with multiple people and find yourself hitting walls when trying to get to your documents because you're logged into someone else's Google account?

Google's Chrome browser allows users to log in to multiple accounts at the same time and switch back and forth by clicking on your name in the top right corner.

If you're on a public computer or don't want to bother with maintaining multiple profiles, you can open an Incognito (Chrome) or Private Browsing (Firefox) window by clicking in the top right corner of either browser or hitting Cmd+Shift+N/Ctrl+Shift+N. Incognito/Private browsing allows you to stay signed in until all of the browser windows are closed, at which time you will be logged out and the browsing history will be erased.

###Filetypes
Filetypes can make a world of difference if you want to move your file between different applications or if you want to take advantage of particular affordances of different filetypes.
####Text
A plain text editor is helpful when you're writing code or HTML, want to view XML-endcoded texts, or just want to look at text without the formatting (e.g bold, italics, weird spacing) issues that can come from copying text from HTML, Word, or PDFs. Operating systems come with text editors (Windows has Notepad and OS X has Text Edit - although it defaults to rich text), but you may desire more features. Sublime Text (Windows and OS X) is perhaps the most populuar and feature-laden, though Notepad ++ (Windows) and Text Wrangler (OS X) are also quite popular.

- .txt | No font type, size, formatting, or hyperlinks - just the characters
- .docx | Includes formatting for Microsoft Word program (though other applications are capable of opening, editing, and saving docx)
- .csv | [Comma Separated Values] Plain text spreadsheet data format with commas as "delimiters," or markings between values. Tab separated value (tsv) is a similar format
- .xlsx | Data in spreadsheet form, including formatting information or multiple spreadsheets
- .pdf | A fixed layout for the visual presentation of a document. It may have copyable text, but it's usually formatted with built-in page breaks and other strange formatting.
